You dont open an app. You just talk. Thats what Zomatos MCP (Model Context Protocol) server is designed to do its the invisible intelligence that connects AI models like ChatGPT or Claude directly to real-world data and actions. What Exactly is an MCP Server? At its core, an MCP server acts as a bridge between AI systems (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini) and external services or data. Think of it like a translator that lets AI talk to real-world APIs in context. Instead of the AI just knowing things, it can do things. Want to book a table? MCP calls Zomatos booking API. Need"

    "title": "Outbidding and Outbluffing Elite Humans: Mastering Liar's Poker via\n  Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning",
    "summary": "AI researchers have long focused on poker-like games as a testbed for environments characterized by multi-player dynamics, imperfect information, and reasoning under uncertainty. While recent breakthroughs have matched elite human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued: most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies, randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.",

Dr. Maya Patel, HealthTech Enthusiast Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer just a buzzword whispered in the corridors of tech startups. Its now a tangible force reshaping hospitals, pharmacies, and even the way we talk about wellness. At its core, AI is about teaching machines to learn from data, recognize patterns, and make decisions often faster and more accurately than humans. In healthcare, this means quicker diagnoses, smarter drug development, and personalized care for every patient. The result? A medical landscape that feels not only more efficient but also more compassionate. Applications of AI in Healthcare 1. AI in Diagnosis From spotting early signs of diabetic retinopathy with a single eye scan to interpreting X-rays for subtle pneumonia indicators, AI diagnostic tools have become the newest first responders in healthcare. Googles DeepMind has developed an algorithm that detects eye diseases with accuracy comparable to expert"

Its not magic, but its pretty close. The technology behind ChatGPT represents one of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, fundamentally changing how humans interact with machines. You dont need a Medium membership you can read my full article here Heres a mind-blowing fact: The latest GPT-5 model can understand context across 400,000 tokens (roughly 300,000 words) thats like reading an entire novel and remembering every detail simultaneously. But how does a machine do this? This matters now more than ever because ChatGPT isnt just a chatbot anymore its becoming an integral part of how we work, learn, create, and solve problems. From helping architects design buildings to assisting doctors with medical questions, understanding how it works helps us use it better and build even more amazing things.

Towards AI Editorial Team 6 min read 2 hours ago 2 hours ago -- Share Press enter or click to view image in full size Good morning, AI enthusiasts, This week, we explore how AI systems are learning to reason, cooperate, and communicate. We will walk through building a ReAct agent from scratch using LangGraph, showing how reasoning loops, tool use, and structured planning can turn a model into a real problem solver. From there, we look at emerging standards shaping agentic interoperability. Docling MCP introduces a modular approach to document processing, while the Agent2Agent Protocol lays the groundwork for a connected ecosystem of AI systems that can talk to each other. Youll also find a fascinating look at Tiny Recursive Models that outperform giant LLMs on reasoning tasks, and a visual guide to Rotary Position Embeddings the trick behind modern long-context models. Lets get into it. Whats AI Weekly This week in Whats AI, I shared a few important developments directly relevant to our community. I talk about Cursors update and their new"

    "title": "Grounded Misunderstandings in Asymmetric Dialogue: A Perspectivist\n  Annotation Scheme for MapTask",
    "summary": "Collaborative dialogue relies on participants incrementally establishing common ground, yet in asymmetric settings they may believe they agree while referring to different entities. We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme for the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression, enabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over time. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask referential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating (V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative dialogue.",

We've improved streaming to have 100x fewer requests, 10 faster data resolution 2x sample/sec, 0 worker crashes at 256 concurrent workers. Loading data, especially at the terabyte scale, is a major pain in any machine learning workflow. We suffered this while training SmolLM3, at one point we had to wait 3 hours before each run to download enough data. Streaming has always been possible in the datasets library, but large scale training with massive datasets remained a challenge. That changes today . We spent a few months improving the backend, focusing on streaming datasets to make it faster and more efficient. What did we do exactly?

But compute is only one side of the coin. The other side is the developer community; the people and tools that make agentic systems possible. Thats why Meta and Hugging Face are partnering to launch the OpenEnv Hub : a shared and open community hub for agentic environments. Agentic environments define everything an agent needs to perform a task: the tools, APIs, credentials, execution context, and nothing else. They bring clarity, safety, and sandboxed control to agent behavior. These environments can be used for both training and deployment, and serve as the foundation for scalable agentic development. The Problem Modern AI agents can act autonomously across thousands of tasks. However, a large language model isnt enough to get those tasks to actually run it needs access to the right tools. Exposing millions of tools directly to a model isnt reasonable (or safe). Instead, we need agentic environments: secure, semantically clear sandboxes that define exactly whats required for a task, and nothing more. These environments"
